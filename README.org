* emacs-0x0

Integration with [[https://0x0.st][0x0.st]] services from emacs. Intended for use in ERC to share images, files, and blocks of code.

The commands this package offers:

- ~0x0-dwim~ chooses the right one of the following, based on location or previous commands.
- ~0x0-upload-text~ will upload the active region or if not existent the entire buffer
- ~0x0-upload-file~ will upload a selected file
- ~0x0-upload-kill-ring~ uploads the content of the kill ring
- ~0x0-popup~ creates and displays a buffer and lets you uploads it contents later
- ~0x0-shorten-uri~ prompts for a uri, shortens it

** Installation

*** MELPA

Coming soon.

*** Doom Emacs (straight.el recipe + use-package)

With doom and straight it is easy to install the package directly from this gitlab repository. In /.doom.d/packages.el/:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
(package! 0x0
  :recipe (:host gitlab :repo "willvaughn/emacs-0x0"))
#+end_src

The minimal config to get started in your /.doom.d/config.el/ is:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval no
(use-package! 0x0)
#+end_src

** Basic Usage

Use cases:

- From anywhere: ~0x0-upload-file~, pick a file, you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- From anywhere: ~0x0-shorten-uri~, paste in the url you want shortened, you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- From a dired buffer: put your cursor on the file you want to share, use ~0x0-upload-file~ or ~0x0-dwim~, you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- From a code file: ~0x0-upload-text~ or ~0x0-dwim~, the entire file is uploaded and you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- From a code file, with a region selected: ~0x0-upload-text~ or ~0x0-dwim~, the selected text is uploaded and you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- From anywhere: ~0x0-popup~, opens a buffer, paste and write things into it, when you're ready to upload it to 0x0 press ~C-c C-c~, you now have a 0x0 uri in your clipboard.
- Choosing servers: Add the ~C-u~ prefix argument and you'll be prompted for a server choice. This let's you upload to [[https://envs.sh]], [[https://ttm.sh]], or a server you run yourself.

** Known Bugs & Limitations

*** Multibyte Files (PNG, PDF, etc) Only Work With =curl=

If you have =(setq 0x0-use-curl nil)= you will fall back to the =url= package in emacs. You will not be able to upload an image, pdf, or any other type of file that contains multibyte data. If someone knows how to use the =url= in a way that makes this work, please contribute a patch.

*** URI Shortening Only Works With =curl=

Calling =0x0-shorten-uri= without having support for curl is not implemented at this time. It throws an error if you don't have curl installed, or if you have =(setq 0x0-use-curl nil)=.

*** =0x0-dwim= Considered Dangerous

You can upload information you didn't intend to when using =0x0-dwim= much easier than you can when using other commands.

**** =0x0-dwim= EVIL Bug

Beware of =0x0-dwim= if you are an evil-mode user. In fact, I'd say until it is significantly changed or made more customizable, it should be avoided. You yanked a bit of code like the following using ~evil-yank~ and then hit ~M-x 0x0-dwim~ intending to upload from your kill-ring.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never
;;;###autoload
(defun my-fun-fun (a)
  (+ 2 a))
#+end_src

Oh, when you yanked your cursor was still on that word =autoload= though! You didn't just upload your yanked text, for some reason you just uploaded a gzip file that contains an =autoload.el= file from somewhere on your system. If you accidentally have your cursor on a word like =id_rsa= when you run =0x0-dwim=, :facepalm: maybe you just uploaded your private ssh keys. I don't know, because I haven't actually tried it. I don't know which words will cause strange events like this.

*Note: This is so egregious that 0x0-dwim needs to be significantly neutralized or removed altogether*
